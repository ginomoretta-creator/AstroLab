Quantum-Assisted Initialization for Low-Thrust Earth–Moon Trajectories

**Abstract text**:

Low-thrust Earth–Moon transfers are highly sensitive problems, and classical optimal-control solvers converge reliably only when provided with a meaningful initial profile. This work studies whether quantum computing can assist the early exploration of discrete thrust-activation patterns that seed those solvers more effectively.



The timeline is discretized into binary activation decisions. Rather than relying on random or handcrafted schedules, quantum routines generate and evaluate large sets of candidate thrust/coast patterns under the same computational budget, increasing coverage of the combinatorial space. Promising discrete patterns are then smoothed into continuous control inputs and refined with a classical optimal-control solver to ensure dynamical consistency.



The goal is not to replace deterministic optimization but to test whether quantum-assisted pattern exploration can accelerate the search for viable low-thrust structures in Earth–Moon transfers. The study provides an initial assessment of how quantum computation could complement classical methods in future cislunar trajectory design.
